My name is Nicolo Agbayani and I am a first year computer science major at Drexel University. I enjoy taking on programming projects such as developing games in various programming langauges and Discord bots to further my understanding of computer science and branch into new topics. Currently, I am the marketing chair for Drexel's chapter of SASE (Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers) and also enjoy graphic and logo design as a hobby.
